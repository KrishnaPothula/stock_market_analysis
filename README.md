“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” - George Santayana

According to popular belief, stock markets are fundamentally random walks, and attempting to anticipate them is a fool’s game. Predicting stock prices is a difficult task in and of itself due to the numerous variables involved. In the near term, the market operates like a voting machine, but in the long run, it operates like a weighing machine, allowing for the prediction of market movements over a longer timescale. The use of machine learning methods and other algorithms to analyze and forecast stock prices is an area with a lot of potential. In this study, we look at stock prices over a period, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly, to see when they rise or fall.
