According to popular belief, stock markets are fundamentally random  walks, and attempting to anticipate them is a fool's game. Because of the numerous variables involved, predicting stock prices is a difficult task in and of itself. The market operates like a voting machine in the near term, but like a weighing machine in the long run, allowing for the prediction of market movements over a longer timescale. The use of machine learning methods and other algorithms to analyse and forecast stock prices is an area with a lot of potential.In this study, we look at stock prices over a period, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly, to see when they rise or fall.
